		MVC is a design pattern for dynamic websites (websites that need a server component). 

		<br>
		<br>

		MVC has three parts, M, V and C. <br>

		<ul>
			<li>M stands for Model and deals with Data Access Logic.</li>
			<li>V stands for View and deals with Visual Business Logic.</li>
			<li>C stands for Controller and deals with Presentation Logic.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		Or a simpler explanation, the model is the variables that exist on the server side that the users can play with. In 
		Django, the model is handled by Django's database layer, which means that the models need to be set up 
		with data beforehand for the users to play with.

		<br>
		<br>
		
		The view is the website templates that allow the user to interact with the model, processing the database layer 
		before, during and after the user does so.

		<br>
		<br>

		The controller controls which view the user should be shown. It steers the application by handling requests and responses, setting up database connections and loading add-ons. Django does a lot of this in it's setings file so that it knows what to load and set up. Django also has a URL file so it knows what to do with the incoming requests from browsers.
